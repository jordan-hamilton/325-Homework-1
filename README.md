###### Homework 1

Implement merge sort and insertion sort to sort an array/vector of integers.

You may implement the algorithms in C, C++ or Python, name the programs “mergesort” and “insertsort”. Your programs should be able to read inputs from a file called “data.txt” where the first value of each line is the number of integers that need to be sorted, followed by the integers.

**Example values for data.txt:**
4 19 2 5 11
8 1 2 3 4 5 6 1 2

The output will be written to files called “merge.txt” and “insert.txt”. For the above example the output would be:

2 5 11 19

1 1 2 2 3 4 5 6

Submit a copy of all your code files and a README file that explains how to compile and run your code in a ZIP file to TEACH. We will test execution with an input file named data.txt.
